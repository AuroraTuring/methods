# Self-Evaluation

- Reflect on your learning and work today. What are you most proud of?
I'm proud of my methods working on the first attempt or two.

- What is the power of using methods in our applications?
  It makes it so we don't have to type out an entire equation every time we need to use it, it's stored for later use.
